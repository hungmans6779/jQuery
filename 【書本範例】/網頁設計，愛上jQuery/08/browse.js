	This is the real meat of the jQuery functionality.
	We are performing 3 major tasks:

	1.) Grab each "title" node from our XML data source that

	2.) Now of those title nodes, filter out those that are
	    greater than a certain index. This will give us our
	    new result set, which is displayed to the user with
		"Showing X through Y of Z". The ":gt" expression is
		used in conjunction with the "filter()" method to
		accomplish this task.
	3.) For each set of results we refined, we now want to
	    execute a function. We know we need the "author",
		"publisher", and the "ISBN" for our book, but we
		only searched for "title". With the "each()" method
		we have access to the index (i), just like in a JavaScript
		"for loop". So we can get each one of those nodes
		that fall at the same index as our "title" nodes.
		However, we always start our results array at 0,
		so we want to add our current position to that
		in order to get the proper node. We use the ":eq"
		expression to accomplish this task.
